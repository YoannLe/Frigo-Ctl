# Frigo-Ctl
Arduino controller and thermostat with touch screen for 12V Fridge Compressor. Boat, RV, motorhome. To drive Danfoss, SECOP, vitrifrigo, 101N0212 compressors control units.

Compressors RPM, start and stop could be controled by resistors values and mechanical thermostat.

To set the best ratio between compressor speed and cold generation needed, the AOE protocol was developed on high end devices. This project coud genarate AOE control on a standard unit and specials functions like manual boost, graphic touch screen and DS18B20 temperature sensors.
